This a small web app that allows the user to create their own burger and order it.

To run locally, you can do:

### git clone https://github.com/Odisseuss/Burger-Builder

and then,

### npm install && npm run start

A new tab should open in your browser displaying the app, but if not, you can navigate to localhost:3000 to view the app.
